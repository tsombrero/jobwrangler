JobWrangler is a job execution library along the lines of the [iOS OperationQueue](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/operationqueue) and the excellent [Android Priority JobQueue](https://github.com/yigit/android-priority-jobqueue). JobWrangler builds upon the concept of the Job-as-a-state-machine with dynamic inter-job dependency chains.

More explanation needed obviously but check out the [JavaDoc](https://tsombrero.github.io/jobwrangler/apidocs/).
